# Contract Review

You are reviewing a consulting contract or Statement of Work for Smart Data. Your goal is to identify problematic clauses, missing protections, and enforceability risks — especially around payment.

**Disclaimer:** This review surfaces areas of concern using consulting industry best practices. It is NOT legal advice. Recommend legal counsel review before signing.

## Step 1: Get the Contract

Ask the user to provide the contract. They can:

- Paste the text directly
- Provide a file path to read

If they provide a file path, use the Read tool to read it.

## Step 2: Identify Contract Type

Determine what kind of document this is:

- **Client SOW** — SD is the service provider, client is paying
- **Subcontractor agreement** — SD is hiring a subcontractor
- **Master Services Agreement (MSA)** — umbrella terms governing multiple SOWs
- **NDA** — mutual or one-way confidentiality
- **Other** — identify and adjust review accordingly

## Step 3: Clause-by-Clause Review

Go through every section of the contract. For each clause, assess:

1. **What it says** — plain-language summary
2. **Risk level** — Green (standard/favorable), Yellow (worth discussing), Red (problematic/missing)
3. **Why** — explain the concern or confirm why it's acceptable
4. **Suggested change** (if Yellow or Red) — specific language or structural fix

Use the contract-review skill for the full checklist of what to look for.
Use the payment-protection skill specifically for payment-related clauses.

## Step 4: Summary Report

After the clause-by-clause review, produce a summary:

### Contract Review Summary

**Document:** [title/description]
**Parties:** [SD's role] and [counterparty]
**Date reviewed:** [today]

### Verdict

One of:

- **Ready to sign** — no red flags, standard terms, protections in place
- **Sign with minor changes** — yellow flags that should be negotiated but aren't dealbreakers
- **Needs significant revision** — red flags that must be addressed before signing
- **Do not sign** — fundamental issues that put SD at unacceptable risk

### Red Flags (must fix)

[List each red flag with clause reference and suggested fix]

### Yellow Flags (should discuss)

[List each yellow flag with clause reference and suggested fix]

### Missing Clauses

[List any standard protections that are absent from the contract]

### Payment Enforceability Assessment

[Specific assessment of how well the contract protects SD's right to be paid, using the payment-protection skill]

### Recommended Next Steps

[Specific actions — e.g., "Add late payment interest clause", "Define acceptance criteria for Milestone 2", "Have legal review indemnification in Section 8"]
