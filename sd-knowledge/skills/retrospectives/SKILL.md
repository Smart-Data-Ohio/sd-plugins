# Project Retrospectives

This directory contains retrospective summaries from completed Smart Data projects. These capture lessons learned to improve future engagements.

## Retrospective Format

Each retro follows this structure:

- **Project**: Name and brief description
- **Duration**: Start/end dates
- **Team Size**: Number of team members
- **What Went Well**: Practices and decisions that contributed to success
- **What Could Be Improved**: Issues encountered and their root causes
- **Action Items**: Concrete changes for future projects

## How to Use

- Review retros from similar projects before starting new engagements
- Reference specific lessons when making project decisions
- Use patterns from "What Went Well" as starting points for new projects
- Avoid repeating patterns from "What Could Be Improved"
