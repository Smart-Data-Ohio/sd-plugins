# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant technical decisions made across Smart Data projects.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: Short descriptive name
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context**: What prompted the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: What results from this decision (positive and negative)

## How to Use

- Reference ADRs when starting new projects to avoid re-debating settled decisions
- When a decision needs revisiting, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
- Include relevant ADRs in project documentation
