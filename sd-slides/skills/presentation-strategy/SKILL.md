# Presentation Strategy for Consulting Decks

A framework for building effective proposal and pitch decks for Smart Data's consulting engagements. Covers deck structure, slide content guidelines, and narrative flow.

## Deck Types

### Proposal Deck (12-16 slides)

Used when responding to an RFP or presenting a project proposal to a potential client. The narrative arc: _we understand your problem → here's how we'd solve it → here's the team → here's the investment → here's why us_.

**Template sequence:**

1. **cover** — Project title, client industry (not name if pre-engagement), date
2. **agenda** — 4-5 items, keep it to one line each
3. **content-bullets** — "Understanding the Challenge" — client's pain points, framed as business problems
4. **content-bullets** — "Our Approach" — methodology, phases, how SD works
5. **process-flow** — Engagement methodology as numbered steps
6. **architecture** (optional) — Proposed system design with layered components
7. **team** — Proposed team members, roles, relevant experience
8. **timeline** — Phase-based, 3-5 milestones, high-level dates
9. **investment** — Pricing tiers if applicable (Essential / Standard / Premium)
10. **comparison** (optional) — Current state vs. proposed solution
11. **case-study** — Relevant project spotlight with results
12. **differentiators** — 3-4 value propositions
13. **stats-metrics** (optional) — Key impact numbers from past engagements
14. **next-steps** — Clear call to action, proposed timeline for decision
15. **thank-you** — Contact info

### Pitch Deck (7-10 slides)

Used for introductory meetings, capability overviews, or when a client asks "tell me about Smart Data." Shorter, broader, less project-specific.

**Template sequence:**

1. **cover** — "Smart Data" title, tagline
2. **content-bullets** — "Who We Are" — brief company overview
3. **content-bullets** — "What We Do" — service lines
4. **stats-metrics** — Key company numbers (years in business, projects delivered, team size)
5. **case-study** — Featured project spotlight
6. **quote-testimonial** (optional) — Client testimonial
7. **team** — Key team members or team structure overview
8. **differentiators** — What sets SD apart
9. **next-steps** — Contact info, proposed follow-up

### Capability Deck (10-14 slides)

Used to showcase a specific service line (e.g., "Smart Data's Snowflake Practice" or "Our Custom Development Services").

**Template sequence:**

1. **cover** — Service line title
2. **content-bullets** — Overview of what this practice does
3. **section-divider** — "Our Approach"
4. **process-flow** — Methodology as step-by-step flow
5. **two-column** — Technical capabilities and certifications
6. **team** — Key practitioners, credentials
7. **section-divider** — "Results"
8. **case-study** — Project spotlight with results (repeat for 2-3)
9. **quote-testimonial** (optional) — Client testimonial
10. **stats-metrics** — Aggregate impact numbers
11. **differentiators** — Why SD for this service
12. **next-steps**

## Content Guidelines

### Text Per Slide

| Slide Type      | Max Text                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Cover           | Title + 1 subtitle sentence                      |
| Agenda          | 4-5 single-line items                            |
| Content Bullets | 3-4 bullets, each 1 sentence                     |
| Architecture    | 3-4 layers with 2-4 components each              |
| Team            | Name, role, 1-line credential per person (max 6) |
| Timeline        | 3-5 phases with duration and description         |
| Investment      | 4-6 line items with costs and total              |
| Differentiators | 3-4 cards with heading and description           |
| Next Steps      | 2-3 action items with owners and timing          |

### Writing Style

- **Lead with business value, not technology.** "Reduce report generation time from 3 days to 3 hours" beats "Implement automated ETL pipeline with dbt and Snowflake"
- **Use the client's language.** Mirror the terminology from their RFP or conversations
- **One idea per slide.** If a slide needs a scroll, split it
- **No paragraphs.** Bullets only. The presenter fills in the detail verbally
- **Quantify everything possible.** "Reduced deployment time by 70%" not "Significantly improved deployment speed"
- **Avoid jargon the audience won't know.** If presenting to a CFO, say "data warehouse" not "Snowflake with medallion architecture"

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too many slides.** A 30-slide proposal loses the audience. Cut ruthlessly
2. **Reading the slides aloud.** Slides are visual aids, not scripts. Less text = better presentation
3. **Generic content.** "We deliver innovative solutions" means nothing. Be specific to this client and project
4. **No clear ask.** Every deck should end with a concrete next step — "Sign SOW by March 1" not "Let us know"
5. **Inconsistent branding.** Always use the template library. Don't mix fonts or color palettes
6. **Missing the audience.** Technical depth for executives, business value for developers — both are wrong. Know your audience
7. **Burying the price.** If investment is a key factor, don't hide it on slide 28. Put it where the natural conversation leads

## Quality Checklist

Before presenting:

- [ ] Does every slide pass the "5-second test"? (Can someone understand it in 5 seconds?)
- [ ] Is the deck under 15 slides for proposals, under 8 for pitches?
- [ ] Does the narrative flow logically? (problem → solution → proof → ask)
- [ ] Is the client name correct everywhere?
- [ ] Do team bios match the actual proposed team?
- [ ] Are pricing figures current and approved?
- [ ] Has someone other than the author reviewed it?
- [ ] Have you opened the .pptx in PowerPoint to verify layout and branding?
