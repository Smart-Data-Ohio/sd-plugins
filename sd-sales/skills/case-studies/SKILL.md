# Smart Data Case Studies

Use these case studies when responding to RFPs or drafting proposals. Select the most relevant examples based on the prospect's industry, technology stack, and project type.

## How to Use Case Studies in Proposals

1. Select 2-3 case studies most relevant to the prospect's needs
2. Highlight similar technology, industry, or challenge
3. Emphasize measurable outcomes (cost savings, performance improvements, timeline)
4. Adapt the narrative to match the prospect's situation
