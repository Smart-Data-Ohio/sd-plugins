# Harvest V2 API Knowledge

## Available MCP Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `list_projects` | List Harvest projects with client, task, and billable info. Filter by active status. |
| `get_me`        | Get current authenticated user's profile (name, email, timezone, roles).             |
| `get_entries`   | Query time entries by date range and optional project filter.                        |
| `create_entry`  | Create a new time entry with project, task, date, hours, notes. _(Milestone 3)_      |

## API Concepts

### Projects and Tasks

- Projects belong to Clients (e.g., "Ferguson Portal" belongs to "Ferguson Enterprises")
- Each project has one or more Tasks (e.g., "Development", "Meetings", "Project Management")
- Time entries require both a `project_id` and a `task_id`
- Projects can be billable or non-billable
- `list_projects` returns task assignments for each project (id, name, billable)

### Time Entries

- `spent_date` uses YYYY-MM-DD format
- `hours` is decimal (1.5 = 1 hour 30 minutes)
- `notes` is the description field visible on invoices
- Entries inherit billable status from their project/task
- Query entries with `get_entries` using `from` and `to` date parameters

### Authentication

- Uses Personal Access Token (not OAuth)
- Requires both `HARVEST_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variables
- Token obtained from: Harvest web app > Settings > Developers > Personal Access Tokens

### Rate Limits

- 100 requests per 15 seconds
- 429 response includes `Retry-After` header

## Local Storage

The plugin stores local data in `~/.sd-harvest/`:

| File            | Purpose                                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mappings.json` | Maps git repo paths to Harvest project/task pairs. Written by `/harvest:map`. |
| `logs.json`     | Daily work log entries (natural language). Written by `/harvest:log`.         |

### mappings.json format

```json
{
  "/path/to/repo": {
    "project_id": 12345,
    "task_id": 67890,
    "project_name": "Project Name",
    "task_name": "Task Name"
  }
}
```

### logs.json format

```json
[
  {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "repo": "/path/to/repo",
    "repo_name": "repo-name",
    "mapping": {
      "project_id": 0,
      "task_id": 0,
      "project_name": "",
      "task_name": ""
    },
    "entries": [
      { "text": "Description of work", "start": "ISO 8601", "end": "ISO 8601" }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Common Patterns

### Querying a week of entries

Use `get_entries` with `from` (Monday YYYY-MM-DD) and `to` (Friday YYYY-MM-DD).

### Creating entries for a full day

A standard workday is 8 hours. Multiple entries for a day should sum to 8.0.

### Finding the right project/task IDs

Use `list_projects` to get project IDs, names, and their task assignments (task ID, name, billable status).
